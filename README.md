# aralotproject
This repository contains the scripts related to my master's thesis project.
The project first aimed at uncovering the core parts of the endophytic leaf microbiome of the model plants Lotus corniculatus and Arabidopsis thaliana.
The unique core microbiome members were then used as a template for the assemblage of a synthetic community.
The synthetic community was now used to assess questions around host selectivity or viewed from the other side microbe adaptability.
Here I would also like to thank everyone involved for their tremendous help.
