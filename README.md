# aralotproject
This repository contains the scripts related to my master's thesis project.
The project first aimed at uncovering the core parts of the endophytic leaf microbiome of the model plants Lotus corniculatus and Arabidopsis thaliana.
The unique core microbiome members were then used as a template for the assemblage of a synthetic community.
Now the synthetic community could be used to assess questions around host selectivity or viewed from the other side the host adaptability of members of said community.
Here I would also like to thank everyone involved for their tremendous help.
